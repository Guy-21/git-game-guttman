You are correct - it is the best school.
BTW - there is the an example of the .gitignore file.

It has been a long long way.
Now, the end is close.
All you have to do is:

1. Open a new git repository in github - with your name as it's name (First and last).
2. Create a branch called 'my-new-branch'.
3. make some changes - go wild.
4. make sure you stage, commit and push them.
5. merge them to the master/main branch.
6. send me the github repos link.
7. most importantly - use what you learnt now in your projects - trust me - it will help you.

I hope you had fun. <br>
